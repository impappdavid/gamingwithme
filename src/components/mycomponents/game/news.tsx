                        Valve has dropped the Armory Pass in CS2, and itâ€™s their boldest step yet toward a modern battle pass system. Unlike previous operations, the Armory Pass gives players weekly missions, exclusive weapon skins, and a progression-based reward system.

                        Players can complete challenges to earn stars, which unlock tiered rewards like limited-time cosmetics, stickers, and cases. Itâ€™s sleek, accessible, and feels much more integrated into CS2â€™s competitive rhythm.
                    </span>
                    With a fresh map pool and ranking reset coming in Season 3, the Armory Pass is the perfect way to grind rewards while climbing the ranks.
